# KPI Calculation Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The original `calculateFinancials` function in `SubmitRequest.tsx` was using overly simplified calculations:

- IRR: `(annualSavings / totalCost) * 100` - This is not the correct IRR formula
- NPV: `annualSavings * 5 - totalCost` - This ignores time value of money
- Payback: `totalCost / annualSavings` - This was correct but lacked partial year calculation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Financial Calculator Utility (`src/lib/financialCalculator.ts`)

#### Core Functions:

- **`calculateNPV()`**: Implements proper NPV formula: `NPV = Σ[CFₜ / (1 + r)ᵗ] - C₀`
- **`calculateIRR()`**: Uses Newton-Raphson method to find the discount rate where NPV = 0
- **`calculatePaybackPeriod()`**: Includes partial year interpolation for accurate payback calculation
- **`calculateROI()`**: Standard ROI calculation: `(Total Return - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment * 100`

#### Supporting Functions:

- **`generateCashFlows()`**: Creates cash flow arrays from project inputs
- **`getDefaultDiscountRate()`**: Provides risk-adjusted discount rates based on business case types
- **`estimateAnnualCashInflow()`**: Estimates cash inflows based on project characteristics
- **`validateFinancialInputs()`**: Validates input parameters

### 2. Updated SubmitRequest Component

#### Key Changes:

- **Added discount rate input field** in KPI & Analysis step
- **Replaced simplified calculations** with proper financial formulas
- **Added business case type adjustments** for discount rates and cash flow estimates
- **Enhanced error handling** and validation
- **Added detailed calculation basis** in the form output

#### New Features:

- **Dynamic discount rate suggestions** based on business case types
- **Real-time calculation basis** showing all inputs used
- **Proper validation** of financial inputs
- **Business case-specific adjustments** for more accurate projections

### 3. Financial Formulas Implemented

#### NPV (Net Present Value):

```
NPV = -Initial Investment + Σ[Cash Flowₜ / (1 + r)ᵗ]
```

Where:

- `r` = discount rate
- `t` = time period
- Cash flows include both inflows and outflows

#### IRR (Internal Rate of Return):

```
Find r where: NPV = 0
```

Implemented using Newton-Raphson numerical method for accuracy.

#### Payback Period:

```
Payback = Full Years + (Remaining Investment / Cash Flow in Partial Year)
```

Includes proper partial year interpolation.

### 4. Business Case Type Adjustments

#### Discount Rate Adjustments:

- **Base Rate**: 10%
- **ESG Projects**: +2% (higher risk/longer term)
- **IPO Prep**: +3% (higher risk)
- **Cost Control**: -1% (lower risk)

#### Cash Flow Adjustments:

- **Base Return**: 15% of investment
- **Cost Control**: 20% (higher efficiency gains)
- **ESG**: 12% (longer term benefits)
- **IPO Prep**: 18% (higher returns)

### 5. Example Validation

Using the provided example:

- **Initial Investment**: $500,000
- **Annual Cash Inflow**: $75,000
- **Discount Rate**: 10%
- **Project Duration**: 10 years

#### Results:

- **IRR**: ~8.14% (correctly calculated as the rate where NPV = 0)
- **NPV**: ~-$39,155 (negative due to high discount rate vs. cash flows)
- **Payback Period**: ~6.67 years (500,000 / 75,000)
- **ROI**: ~50% (total return vs. investment)

### 6. User Interface Enhancements

#### KPI & Analysis Step:

- **Discount Rate Configuration** section with:
  - Input field for custom discount rate
  - Default rate suggestions based on business case types
  - Real-time effective rate display
- **Enhanced calculation button** with proper error handling
- **Detailed calculation basis** showing all inputs and methodology

### 7. Error Handling & Validation

- **Input validation** for positive investments and valid discount rates
- **Graceful error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Fallback calculations** when inputs are missing
- **Business logic validation** for project feasibility

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Accurate Financial Analysis**: Uses industry-standard formulas
2. **Risk-Adjusted Calculations**: Considers business case types
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear inputs and explanations
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Prevents invalid calculations
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new business case types
6. **Professional Quality**: Suitable for production investment analysis
